# Absence Manager
This project was developed during a Hickathon with the objective of creating an app to manage employee vacations/absences.

## Technologies

- Node.js and Express for the backend
- Angular for the frontend
- PostgreSQL for the database

## Additional Information

- The project does not have a CSS style sheet due to time constraints.
- The challenge is not fully complete. The functionalities related to the "manager" (approve, deny, or delete a request) have not been developed yet.

## Installation

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using npm install.
3. Set up a PostgreSQL database and create the necessary tables using the database.sql file.
4. Start the backend server using npm start in the root directory.
5. Start the frontend server using ng serve in the frontend directory.
6. Open http://localhost:4200 in your browser to use the app.

## Usage

The app allows employees to submit vacation/absence requests and view their own requests. The manager functionalities are not yet available.
